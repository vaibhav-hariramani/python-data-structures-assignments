"Lists are mutable and tuples are not mutable"

Question 2
Which of the following methods work both in Python lists and Python tuples?

"index()"

Question 3
What will end up in the variable y after this code is executed?
x , y = 3, 4

"4"

Question 4
In the following Python code, what will end up in the variable y?
x = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'fred' : 42, 'jan': 100}
y = x.items()

"A list of tuples"

Question 5

x = (5, 1, 3)
if ??? > x :
   ...

"(6, 0, 0)"

Question 6
What does the following Python code accomplish, assuming the c is a non-empty dictionary?
tmp = list()
for k, v in c.items() :
    tmp.append( (v, k) )

"It creates a list of tuples where each tuple is a value, key pair"

Question 7
If the variable data is a Python list, how do we sort it in reverse order?

"data.sort(reverse=True)"

Question 8
Using the following tuple, how would you print 'Wed'?
days = ('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun')

"print(days[2])"

Question 9
In the following Python loop, why are there two iteration variables (k and v)?
c = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
for k, v in c.items() :
    ...

"Because the items() method in dictionaries returns a list of tuples"

Question 10
Given that Python lists and Python tuples are quite similar - when might you prefer to use a tuple over a list?

"For a temporary variable that you will use and discard without modifying"
